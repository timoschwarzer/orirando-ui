        The Starved variation reduces the probability that players will be given skill pickups,
        unless one is needed to proceed.This tends to create more linear seeds, where each skill
        gives access to the area or areas where the next skill or important item will be found.

        Note that the Balanced fill algorithm can sometimes interfere with Starved.

        Recommended for everyone at least once, and for players who enjoy more linear pathing
        or constrained situations.
